## Features ✨

- **Real-time Weather Data**:
  - Current temperature (Celsius/Fahrenheit)
  - Weather conditions (sunny, rainy, etc.)
  - Humidity and pressure readings
  - Wind speed and direction
  - Visibility information

- **Location Visualization**:
  - Static map display of searched cities
  - Clean, intuitive interface

- **User-Friendly**:
  - Simple city search functionality
  - Responsive design
  - Error handling for invalid inputs

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- OpenWeatherMap API key (free tier available)
- Basic Python environment setup

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-app.git
   cd weather-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your API key:
   - Create a `config.ini` file:
     ```ini
     [API]
     KEY = your_openweathermap_api_key_here
     ```

## Usage 🖥️

1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. In the app:
   - Enter a city name in the search field
   - Click the search button (🔍) or press Enter
   - View detailed weather information
   - See the city's location on the map

## Project Structure 📂

```

├── README.md          # This documentation
└── assets/            # For storing images/screenshots
```

## How It Works ⚙️

1. **Data Fetching**:
   - User input is sent to OpenWeatherMap API
   - JSON response is parsed for weather data
   - Coordinates are extracted for map display

2. **Display**:
   - Weather data is formatted and shown in clean cards
   - Static map is generated using OpenStreetMap
   - Error messages display for invalid searches

## Troubleshooting 🛠️

**Common Issues**:
- "City not found" error:
  - Check spelling
  - Try larger nearby cities
- No API response:
  - Verify internet connection
  - Check API key validity
- Map not loading:
  - Ensure location coordinates are valid
